This includes any behavior that is intended to degrade or shame others.\n\n2. **Examples of Harassment**: Harassment can include, but is not limited to, the following:\n   - Personal attacks or insults based on personal characteristics such as race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion.\n   - Sharing private information (doxxing) without consent.\n   - Targeted harassment or incitement to harass another user.\n   - Unsolicited sexual content or advances.\n\n3. **Reporting and Enforcement**: Discord encourages users to report harassment and provides tools to block or report other users who engage in such behavior. They review reports and can take actions that include warnings, account suspensions, or permanent bans from the platform.\n\n4. **Support for Victims**: Discord provides resources and support for users who experience harassment. They emphasize the importance of creating a safe and inclusive environment for all users.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
